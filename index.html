			<p class=>I am a self-taught web and software developer motivated by sheer passion and dedication.<br>I have taken a shine to .Net development and have attained an adept level of knowledge with C#, ASP.Net, UWP, Xamarin, XAML, and WPF.<br>Although .Net is my specialty, I have also acquired a great deal of knowledge with web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, JQuery, and React as well as SQL and Entity Framework.</p>

				<u><h5>Lifelong Learner</h5></u><br>
			  <p>I take being a software developer very seriously. Being a lifelong learner is the only way to ensure one keeps pace with an ever changing world of technology. This is my passion and it would be a wasted opportunity to not pursue any and every means I can to increase my knowledge of it.</p>

			  <u><h5>Clean Code</h5></u><br>
			  <p>It's one thing to code. It's another thing entirely to write code that is clean, self-descriptive, and abides by common coding principles like the SOLID principles. Through my coursework and independent study, I have gained the knowledge needed to utilize these methods.</p>

			  <u><h5>Communication</h5></u><br>
			  <p>Being a strong communicator is essential to teamwork. Due to my previous work experiences, I am no stranger to working as part of a team and collaborating with my team members to ensure that we are all on the same page and working towards the same goal.</p>

		<h2>Social Networks</h2>
		<p>I can be found on a few different sources. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bnoel0703/">LinkedIn</a> is a great way to make connections and advance a career. <a href="https://twitter.com/Bnoel0703">Twitter</a>, however, is a more casual network that I utilize to follow certain people whether they be other developers, influencers, or certain companies. I may tweet every once in a blue moon but it is not often.</p>

		<h2>GitHub</h2>
		<p>It goes without explanation that GitHub is by far the most important thing to developers. You can click the logo to be taken straight to my repositories. There, I will be uploading my practice projects from my books as well as online classes and courses.</p>
